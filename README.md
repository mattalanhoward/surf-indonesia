# Harvard CS50 Web Project 0

This is a website advertising a made-up surf camp called Surf Indonesia.

There are 4 pages to the website: a landing page, 2 pages displaying surf photos (one page of photos from Java, one from Sumatra), and an information page containing package info and contact details.

The website aims to meet all of the criteria of Harvard CS50 Web project0.

All photos were taken by me (Oliver Jackson).



Thanks for watching....
